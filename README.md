# Nubeam
Nu.beam is abbreviation of "누.빔" in korean and stands for "누리면서 빔을 쏘다" (Beaming out information while threading through here and there). Its main purpose is to give an acess to information needed under blackout such as electrical supply rates from power plants, electricity usage per city, appropriate technology, countrywide evacuation shelters and so on. On ride of a bicycle, the projected information (visualized data) can be shared with more people with minimal use of electricity and introduce lively vibe to the citizen where anyone can take their turn to become a human messenger for those who are in need of help at blackout situation.
